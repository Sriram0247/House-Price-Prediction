## Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the sale price of each house in the test set. The main evaluation metric is the Root-Mean-Squares-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of predicted value and the logarithm of observed sale price.

### Methods used
* Inferential statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modelling

### Technologies
* Python, Jupyter

## Project Description
* The dataset used for this project is the Ames Housing Dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
* 
* This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression, L1 regularization (Lasso), and L2 regularization (Ridge) techniques to predict the final price of houses in the test set.
* Data visualization techniques used in this project include barplots, histograms, heatmap of correlation matrix, and a plot of Lasso and Ridge coefficients.
